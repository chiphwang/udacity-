# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?

I used the terminal-table gem to modify the serch for type fucntionality by putting the results in a table. I feel like it made it easier to read.


2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) Feature 1... Created a new search by type fucntionality that put the output in tables.
  b) Feature 2... Added a method in udacilist.rb to change priority of a to do item.

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?

It took me about 15 hours.


2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

it took me sometime to understand the code. Once I uderstood the code the tasks became easy.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?

I like the terminal-table gem so I decided to do something with it and I think people ten to chaneg priorities quite often so I thought the change periority would be useful.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?

I think I can get better at using Ruby syntax. Looking at the starter code I noticed that Ruby allows a lot of syntax to be written on a single line.
